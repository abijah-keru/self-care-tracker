**PROJECT OVERVIEW**
Daily Anchor is a lightweight app that:
Lets a user view and manage their personal daily anchors,
Tick off anchors they complete,
Submit a daily check-in,
Tracks streak

**Why I Built It / Problem It Solves**
It helps prevent short ruts from becoming longer-term demotivation. This project is designed for low friction and non-judgmental presence: showing up matters more than perfection. 

**TECHNOLOGIES USED**
The frontend is plain HTML/CSS/JS. Firebase Auth gives secure authentication out of the box.

**How to Use the App (User Guide)**
Sign up / Log in (Email + Password)
View your anchors on the main screen. Default anchors are suggested.
Check an anchor when you complete it.
At end of day, press Submit to save the day’s results. Even if you checked nothing, “You showed up” copy encourages presence.
Streaks update based on daily submissions.

**A Tiny Personal Reflection**
This project started because small, consistent actions helped me out of rough patches. If you use or contribute to Daily Anchor, please keep the design compass in mind: gentle, low-friction, and user-led. The app should make it easier to show up for yourself
